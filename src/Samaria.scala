                         |for a ten year term of office. Your duties are to dispense food, direct
                         |farming, and buy and sell land as needed to support your people. Watch
                         |out for rat infestations and the plague! Grain is the general currency,
                         |measured in bushels. The following will help you in your decisions:
                         |* Each person needs at least 20 bushels of grain per year to survive.
                         |* Each person can farm at most 10 acres of land.
                         |* It takes 2 bushels of grain to farm an acre of land.
                         |* The market price for land fluctuates yearly.
                         |Rule wisely and you will be showered with appreciation at the end of
                         |your term. Rule poorly and you will be kicked out of office!""")
